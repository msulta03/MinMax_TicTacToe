This project was created by Moe M. Sultan on 2/20/2019
The goal for this project was to learn CSS + HTML + JS, and how the DOM interacts
I read an article by Ahmad abdolsaheb at < https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-make-your-tic-tac-toe-game-unbeatable-by-using-the-minimax-algorithm-9d690bad4b37 >
that covered how to implement the minMax algorithim in a Tic Tac toe game
There's also more information about the algorithm provided here < https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fInYh90YMJU > and an great lecture from MIT open courseware is provided here < https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjW3eH0Cik>

cheers!
